# Last.fm pulling data from Spotify TEST repo

Using Python & JavaScript to access last.fm and view my most recently listened to tracks on Spotify. This is a repo only for **testing** and setting up my profile readme. Check out my profile's README with this integrated!

Currently I am only using the JavaScript integration which avoids using redis.
